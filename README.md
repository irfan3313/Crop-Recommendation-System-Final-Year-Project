# Crop-Recommendation-System-Final-Year-Project
We aim to create a system that can accurately tell the farmer the suitable crop to be grown based on the input features of the soil and the temperature conditions of the region. In this system, the models will be trained on a textual dataset carefully engineered after performing feature engineering.
